While the path forward was not entirely defined, there was clear consensus that collaboration across\\nthe industry would be essential.\\n\\nThat inaugural session established the foundation for our work. Representatives from Snowflake, HPE, IBM, Cisco, and AWS\\npresented their perspectives on the trajectory of agentic systems. A live demonstration of multi-agent collaboration on\\nEKS using MCP and A2A protocols illustrated the technical possibilities. The substantive work, however, came in the\\ncollaborative sessions where participants aligned on the community\'s vision, mission, and operational structure. Working\\ngroups were formed and initial priorities established.\\n\\nThe momentum from that first day carried through the following months.\\n\\nWeekly meetings became the cadence for both the full community and individual working groups. [Solo.io](https://solo.io)\\npresented their Agent Gateway approach, contributing to the evolving technical dialogue. The community released their\\nthoughts on\\nthe [evolution of systems architecture](https://agentic-community.com/docs/Artifacts/evolving-systems-architecture). The\\noperations working group developed and published a\\nreference [architecture for agentic systems](https://github.com/agentic-community/wg-operations/tree/main/proposals/0001-reference-architecture),\\naddressing a critical gap in the ecosystem. The security working group delivered\\nan [identity framework](https://agentic-community.com/docs/artifacts/agent-identity-security/) specifically designed for agentic\\nenvironments. [Starter templates](https://github.com/agentic-community/wg-operations/tree/main/projects/agent-building-template)\\nwere created to accelerate development and promote consistent practices across implementations.\\n\\nThe [MCP Gateway Registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry) launched successfully and\\ncontinues to expand (integration with Cisco AI Defense, ongoing pilots with several organizations, and Kubernetes\\nsupport). A [demo](https://github.com/agentic-community/agentic-on-eks) showcasing multi-agent platforms on EKS using\\nMCP and A2A was built. Finally, a [reference implementation](https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-eks/pull/232) of the\\ncommunity architecture was submitted to [AI on EKS](https://awslabs.github.io/ai-on-eks/), demonstrating the practical\\napplication of our collective work.\\n\\nIn six months, we have produced a number of technical artifacts. More significantly, we have established a collaborative\\nframework where organizations work across traditional competitive boundaries to advance the field. This foundation will\\nsupport the work ahead.\\n\\nWhile we produced many artifacts, we acknowledge that our priorities changed and some things were not as impactful as we\\ninitially anticipated. In an effort to continuously improve and focus on our community, we are looking to 2026 to adapt\\nto the ever-changing landscape. To that end, in 2026, we will fold all the working groups into a single meeting. This\\nwill allow us to work more closely together and ensure we stay focused on a common goal. We will continue having our\\nbi-weekly community meetings to highlight the work we\'re doing to the larger community, while those who would like to\\ncollaborate more closely are welcome to continue joining the working group meeting on alternating weeks. We will use our\\ncommunity meetings to discuss specific topics agreed upon in advance. We will update the meeting invite and notes to\\ninclude the topic so that we can all prepare for the discussion. Finally, we would like to affirm our commitment to\\nthought leadership as our north star: there is a wealth of experience to draw from this group and we should strive to\\nshare it with the broader technical community.\\n\\nWe are steadfast in advancing our collective understanding of this fast moving space and continue to believe that,\\ntogether, we can make meaningful advances faster.\\n\\nHave a happy and safe holiday and we\'ll see you all in the new year."}]}}')}}]);
